# My Personal Portfolio 🏆

Hello there 👋 , and welcome to *my personal data portfolio! 🚀*  This website has been in the planning phase for a really long time so I&apos;m glad that I can have this space where I can contribute my data experience, projects, and some knowledge that I have obtained along the way. No matter if you have come here to explore my work, or connect, or to simply learn something new, I welcome you here.

# About 🗃️

This portfolio was created to consolidate my professional journey in the field of data science and analytics. It serves as a centralized hub where visitors can explore my various projects, tutorials, and insights into the world of data. I also share my designing skills.

# Why I build a Data Analyst Portfolio ⚒️

I noticed a lack of good data portfolio themes available, so with my background in web design, I took the chance to develop my own. This theme is designed specifically for data analysts to showcase their work, but it’s flexible enough to be used by anyone, regardless of their field. You can use it as your own portfolio, you can change it however you want and make it personal! Hit me a message if you are interested, I can guide you.
