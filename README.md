# Senior Data Engineer Portfolio 🏆

Hello there 👋, and welcome to my **Senior Data Engineer portfolio! 🚀** This portfolio showcases my years of professional experience designing and building scalable data platforms across agriculture, logistics, healthcare, and financial services along with web development skills. Here you'll find real-world production projects, technical insights, and my journey in cloud-native data engineering. Whether you're here to explore my work, connect, or learn about modern data platforms, I welcome you!

## About 🗃️

This portfolio consolidates my professional journey as a data engineer, from building ETL pipelines to architecting enterprise-scale data lakehouses. It serves as a centralized hub showcasing my expertise in **Azure Databricks**, **Delta Lake**, **Snowflake**, **Apache Spark**, and **AWS**. You'll find production data engineering projects, architecture patterns, and insights into building high-performance data solutions.

## Why I Built a Data Engineering Portfolio ⚒️

I noticed a lack of modern portfolio themes for data engineers showcasing real-world enterprise experience. With my background in both data engineering and web design, I created this portfolio to highlight production-grade data platforms, cloud-native architectures, and scalable pipeline solutions. This theme is designed specifically for **data engineers** to showcase their work—from data lakehouses to multi-tenant SaaS platforms—but it's flexible enough for any technical role. If you're interested in using this for your own portfolio, hit me up and I can guide you through customization!
