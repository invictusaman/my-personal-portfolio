I finally found some time to add a blog to my portfolio. I'm excited to share my thoughts and projects with you. I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them. Stay tuned for more content!

- you can also use Image component from nextjs

Create a new blog post

To create a new blog post, you can copy the `introducing-blog.mdx` file and rename it to your desired title. Make sure to update the metadata at the top of the file with the new title, description, date, and published status.

```

&nbsp;

#### You can create your own components and use them in your blog posts

```
To create new components, you can add them to the `mdx-components.ts` and style them as you like.
```

&nbsp;

### To use mdx for projects

You need to edit `velite.config.ts` and add the following code:

```ts
const projects = defineCollection({
    name: "Projects",
    // Add the path to your project mdx files
    pattern: "projects/**/*.mdx",
    schema: s
        .object({
            // Add any frontmatter fields you want to use, for example you can check const posts
        })
        .transform(computedFields)
})
```

&nbsp;

And then it is just copy-pasting the code from `/blog/page.tsx` and `/blog/[...slug]/page.tsx` into your own folder path.
