Hello there üëã , and welcome to *my personal data portfolio! üöÄ*  This website has been in the planning phase for a really long time so I&apos;m glad that I can have this space where I can contribute my data experience, projects, and some knowledge that I have obtained along the way. No matter if you have come here to explore my work, or connect, or to simply learn something new, I welcome you here.

## Why I Created This Website? ‚öíÔ∏è

Having a lot of interest in data and web development, I felt the need of have a single platform where all of my work, my skills, thoughts and experiences can be put together. This website serves as a one-stop destination to:

**Showcase My Work:** I have been involved in many web development and data-related activities such as designing, analysis and visualization and this site makes it easy to showcase my work.

**Document My Journey:** In the following blog posts, I will discuss important theories, features, and techniques which I consider to be helpful.

**Connect With Others:** This is a chance for me to connect with another data lover, potential employer, or anyone who is interested to know more about my work and even a chance to get some freelance work.

## Future Plans üì°

I have some exciting plans in mind to keep my portfolio more alive and valuable:

**Project Updates & New Challenges:** I will continuously keep on updating new projects as I expand my knowledge in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Expect future blog posts to include more case studies, the problems I've solved, and the innovative approaches to implementing data solutions in practice.

**Interactive Data Visualizations:** In the near future I expect to enhance the interactivity of data visualizations added to the projects. All the data will be available for you to work through right here on the site.

**Technical Tutorials:** I will post guides that contain steps on how to perform certain things in the tools that I apply in the projects I work on, such as Python coding, creating Tableau dashboards, and others. This will assist others when they want to replicate such projects or when they want to use the skills in a project of their choice.

**Expanding the Portfolio:** When discovering new tools, techniques, and technologies, I am going to add more types of projects and cover various industries in the expanded portfolio section.

**More Pages:** I have planned to add pages where I can show what I'm currently working on, not only related to data, but my life as well, what goals I have set for near future and many more.
