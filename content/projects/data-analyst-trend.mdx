Ever wondered what it's like to be a Data Analyst in Canada? With the demand for data-driven insights skyrocketing, I decided to dig into the numbers and uncover what makes this role tick.

Whether you're curious about the top employers, the hottest skills, or just looking to get your foot in the door, this case study has got you covered. Let's dive into the data and see what it takes to succeed as a Data Analyst in Canada!

Wait, Wait, Wait. Before diving into the data, the first step in any analysis is **asking questions**. *Why are we doing this analysis in the first place? What are we hoping to uncover? What insights will help us make better decisions?* These are the questions that guide the entire process, turning a pile of numbers into something meaningful. Here are a few questions I had in mind:


#### Questions to be answered:

1) Which Data Analyst job titles and roles are most in demand right now?

2) What are the top skills required to land a Data Analyst job?

3) Which provinces and cities offer the most job opportunities?

4) Which employers are hiring the most, and which industry they belong to?

5) How do job opportunities for entry-level or junior positions compare to those for advanced or senior roles?

6) What salary can I expect for different Data positions, and how do factors like work type and seniority affect salary?

By starting with these questions, I set the stage for a data journey that's not just about crunching numbers, but about finding stories within the data. As I delved deeper, I began forming some hypotheses to guide my analysis:

#### Hypotheses

1) I expected Senior Data Analyst positions and Business Intelligence (BI) roles to be the most in demand.
2) As I mentioned in the beginning, I assumed that SQL, Python, and R would be most prevalent in the skillset.
3) I believed that Ontario, and more specifically Toronto, would be the most popular location for Data Analyst jobs.
4) I assumed that large organizations such as the CRA particularly within the Information Technology field would be at the forefront.
5) My initial assumption was that senior positions would encompass considerably more opportunities than junior ones.
6) I proposed the range of salaries from $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 with staff positions being higher and in-person positions being the highest paid.

With these hypotheses in mind, I was ready to dive into the data and see how reality stacks up against my expectations.

### Data Collection

After setting the questions and forming hypotheses, the next step in any data analysis journey is **gathering the information** you need, and that's exactly where I started.

For that, I web scraped job titles listed for Data Analyst roles from both Indeed and Glassdoor, pulling together a raw dataset that captures a snapshot of the current job market. *For those interested in the technical details, I've added the scraper tool I used to my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/invictusaman).*

After gathering the data, I applied various transformation techniques to clean it up, making sure everything was ready for deeper analysis. To keep things transparent and accessible, I’ve made both the raw and cleaned datasets [publicly available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanbhattarai695/data-analyst-job-roles-in-canada). You can access them and follow along as we move into the next step: Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
