            Hi, my name is <b>Aman Bhattarai</b>, and I was born in a small village in <i>Nepal</i>. The very first time I got interested in computers was when my dad introduced a desktop computer to our home while I was in Grade 5. I quickly became fascinated, spending many hours downloading software&apos;s, examining their capabilities and thinking about how one could built such a thing. This curiosity formed at such an early age paved for my love and appreciation for technology and programming.
            <br/>
            <div className="text-center max-w-md mx-auto mt-6 overflow-hidden">
            <Image className="rounded-lg" src='/static/small-me.webp' alt='Small me' width='600' height='800'/>
            <p className="text-sm px-4">Yep, that was me in Grade 5 (probably) !</p>
            </div>
            <br/>
            I was very good at maths from my early school days. <i>Equations and number used to flow naturally to me</i>. I can recall one incident when my maths teacher told me to teach the class for next few days since he was going out of town.
            <br/><br/>
            With this passion for numbers and technologies, I went to <i>Silicon valley of India -- Bangalore</i>, where I did my <b>Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering</b>. There, I did not only improve my programming proficiency but also for the first time I created a personal blog, which is currently live at <a href='https://www.twistblogg.com' rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TwistBlogg.com</a>. I used to post themes and plugins for blogger, and write contents.
            <br/>

            <Image className="rounded-lg" src='/static/bangalore-days.jpg' alt='Bangalore Days' width='800' height='533'/>
            <p className="text-sm px-4">Ethnic day at NHCE College, Bangalore</p>
            </div>
            <br/>
            Besides, I worked on <i>internships</i> related to application development and backend systems allowing me to gain more technical insights and also to improve my interpersonal skills. The Bachelor&apos;s final year project was such a milestone because it involved teaming-up with another team of four members and I was the team leader. This particular experience taught me invaluable lessons in teamwork, management, and collaboration to achieve common goals.
            <br/><br/>
            As I gained more knowledge in the tech field, I found myself naturally drawn to data. Either it was my love for numbers or my passion towards AI. Either way, this led me to do a degree in <b>Artificial Intelligence and Data Science</b> in <i>Canada</i>.
            <br/>
            <div className="text-center max-w-md mx-auto mt-8 overflow-hidden">

            <p className="text-sm px-4">My very first visit to Niagara Falls back in 2021</p>
            </div>
            <br/>
            Moving from web design to data analyst felt like a new level in my career progression. The passion for numbers evolved to the field of data science where I did many personal projects that included aspects of communicating the data. I learned how to make insights from data and translate them into meaningful stories that can be useful for increasing the company&apos;s revenue.
            <br/><br/>
            This journey has further provided me with a number of skills that are necessary in every aspects ranging from the technical set as well as communication and interpersonal skills.
            <br/><br/>
            Looking ahead, I&apos;m keen and very much excited about future opportunities to advance and effectively practice my skills in a professional environment. I&apos;m eager to contribute to new ideas and projects and continue expanding my knowledge in terms of data analysis and visualization.
